==============================
 GIT LEARNING PLAYGROUND
==============================

This repository is just for me to understand and practice Git. 
I'm using it to get hands-on experience with how Git worksâ€” from basic commands to more advanced stuff like branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

------------------------------
 WHY THIS REPO EXISTS
------------------------------

I'm using this as a testing ground to:

- Learn how Git tracks changes
- Understand staging and committing
- Practice branching and merging
- Get comfortable with pushing to and pulling from GitHub
- Experiment freely without worrying about breaking anything

------------------------------
 WHAT I'M PRACTICING
------------------------------

- git clone
- git init
- git status
- git add, git commit
- git log, git diff
- Branching (git branch, git checkout -b)
- Merging and resolving conflicts
- git push, git pull
- .gitignore usage
- Reverting changes and using reset/rebase 

------------------------------
 REPO CONTENTS 
------------------------------

This will just have random files, test commits, merge conflict
samples, and anything I use to try out Git features.
